# DaS-Route
This was the final project for my Algorithms and Data Structures class. I used java and the JGraphT library to model the areas in Dark Souls as a graph. Using Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm, the program will print out the path with the least amount of areas. This could potentially be extended to give weights to each edge of the graph to account for the length of each area in the game. 

The algorithm runs off of the input.txt file located in the Main package of the project. The first line of that file is the origin of the route, the second line is the destination.
